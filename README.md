:x: This required feature does not work.

:beetle: This is a bug that affects the game.


## Adventurer Subclasses

Thief: :white_check_mark: 
> (low stats, gives special and special steals special from enemies and heals self, damages a little)

Healer: :white_check_mark:
> less low health than ^, heals (4hp?), special heals all

Knight: :white_check_mark:
> mid health (27?) high attack (6?) weak support, special attacks all enemies

Skeleton: NOT IMPLEMENTED
> low/mid states (10hp, 3/4 attack, weak support, special is probably to heal self fully)

*Skeleton King* NOT IMPLEMENTED
> 50 hp, 8 attack, special summons skeletons (if team isn't full), support gives himself full special (low amt, more of a turn he uses to charge)

## Gameplay Details

:white_check_mark: Generate a random party of three adventurers (should have all 3 types of adventurers)

:white_check_mark: Use attacks/specials on enemies

:white_check_mark: Use support on team

[ ] Display friendlies / enemies as sprites in the middle (gonna be hard)
