# APCS - Stuyrim

## Features

Make a clear list of features that work/dont work

:white_check_mark: This feature works.

:question: This feature works partially.

:ballot_box_with_check: This extra (beyond the things that the lab was supposed to do) feature works.

:x: This required feature does not work.

:beetle: This is a bug that affects the game.


## Adventurer Subclasses

Thief: already made 
> (low stats, gives special and special steals special from enemies and heals self, damages a little)

Healer: 
> less low health than ^, heals (4hp?), special heals all

Knight: 
> mid health (27?) high attack (6?) weak support, special attacks all enemies

Skeleton: 
> low/mid states (10hp, 3/4 attack, weak support, special is probably to heal self fully)

*Skeleton King* (boss): 
> 50 hp, 8 attack, special summons skeletons (if team isn't full), support gives himself full special (low amt, more of a turn he uses to charge)

## Gameplay Details

- Generate a random party of three adventurers (should have all 3 types of adventurers)

- Play against 1-3 random adventurers (3 normal, 2 normal, or 1 boss)

- Use attacks/specials on enemies

- Use support on team

- Parse input to do ^, or quit

- Display results as text inside border

### Possible Additional features

[ ] Display enemy stats / names on top Name, Health, Special

[ ] Display friendly stats ^ on bottom

[ ] Display friendlies / enemies as sprites in the middle (gonna be hard)

[ ] Make values that change be highlighted briefly, then go back to normal

[ ] Make hit characters shake for a little (change sprite draw offset) for a bit (VERY HARD)

...Add more features later possibly...
